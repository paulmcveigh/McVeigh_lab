My PhD project uses poly-omic approaches and machine learning to identify new biomarker profiles for improved diagnosis of liver fluke infections in sheep. I am working in collaboration with Dr Russ Morphew (Institute of Biological Environmental and Rural Scences, Aberystwyth University), and Ridgeway Research Ltd.
